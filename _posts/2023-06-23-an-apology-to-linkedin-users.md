I've come to realise that you people are all in pain. I've held contempt for you all for a long time, but I seem to have been blindsided. To survive torture you must become ferrel. Sing the same song over and over, never let the tune leave your mind. At some point, each lashing will merge into the next. The mind becomes attune with its new found hell and seeks comfort in the repetitive and inane. Most forget they were ever a person at all. A person with dreams, will, wonder.

Don't mind this message - we have work to do, podcasts to listen to, gyms to go to, neurons to obliterate. Theres nothing more than this and anyone who thinks otherwise should grow up.

Perhaps one day we'll all meet again in paradise. A utopia where we wont have to smile through the pain.
