## Cruelty

Cruelty is not understood well. It's an infection, not a personality trait. The infection is not understood well either. 5 men are beaten, all 5 develop calluses, 4 men will see it all the more reason for others endure what they have - you require the calluses of I to survive this world. 1 man will see it all the more reason to use his new found calluses to fight against the abuser. But in doing so, whether he wins or loses, he no longer has the ability to connect with the uncalloused populus. The perceptive may realise that both paths are an exponential continuation of the abuse, you've been brandished and changed, your life exists to serve the abuser - whether in communion or opposition. You lost. 

Prefer bloody flesh over calluses, take my body before you take my mind. If it really is the case that there are 7 billion other models of myself out there, abundant in flesh and comfort - then it has no value. I'll use it to serve what I love. Find a focal point, let everything converge back into it. Like a deer frozen in the face of oncoming traffic, find a light so beautiful that you cannot help but stop and stare.
