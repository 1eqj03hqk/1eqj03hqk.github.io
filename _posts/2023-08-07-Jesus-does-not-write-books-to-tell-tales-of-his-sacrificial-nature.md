## Jesus does not write books to tell tales of his sacrificial nature

The Jesus I follow recognises the nature of unduly imparted suffering. 

A man who finds himself in a position of seeing truth's that require painful paradigm shifts [to continue living resonantly] does not immediately perk his head out of the crowd and proceed to preach the starkness of the collective situation. Hell propagates mimetically and is proportional to the agent's capacity to model it - which is why communication without undue suffering takes place between two parties that are either equal in ability or antifragile in resolve. 

Suppose a disagreement occurs between two agents. In the absence of a validator, the agent with the finer-grained fidelity model is assumed to be correct as they can see more of the landscape. But of course, that doesn't follow at all - the map maker's feelings towards the hues of his map does not reflect the true hues of the territory. They've developed fine-grained models - years of sleepless nights were spent to procure these high-fidelity models, an outsider can only assume them to be a more accurate representation than their coarse-grained analogues. Shout 'HOPELESS', and an outsider has three options; assume it so and update accordingly, pretend it not so and live stressfully in avoidance or spend years obtaining the sufficient models to simply say 'I don't think you're right'.

All of it can be avoided if the dish is *only* to be served with a side of hope.

This video always makes me cry. A father enduring the worst pain physically possible, brutally suffering for no reason - intermittently tries to use the last of his strength to comfort his daughter. You will need more than a cross for men like this.
