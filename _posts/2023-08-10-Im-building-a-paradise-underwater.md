## I'm building a paradise underwater.

My city, my land, its burning, its ashes and rubble - I can't stand to look at it. It breaks my heart. Underwater I cant breathe, I couldn't reach the bottom for a long time to place even the first brick. But now I've developed a way to hold my breath for longer. I shut off my mind for a moment, I shut off the ability to feel the pain of oxygen starvation, my memories fade while I'm down there. My feelings fade when I'm down there. Sometimes I'll forget I need oxygen at all and get close to death. 

Each time I rise to the surface it all comes flooding back. I'm hit with images of my burning city, I'm hit with the memories that tell me why I'm drowning myself so often. It's the most incredible feeling, the terror of seeing my home gone, the awe of seeing that I'm not an automaton, the wonder of seeing my paradise.
