# Why helping others is not the answer you wished it were

You see, people are building themselves - like builders building houses. Builders don't want material that's already been molded into something. They wish for the most basic of elements to use as building blocks. 

Many who wish to find and help others are actually wishing to find a shared experience with others who've endured in the same novel pain - and in turn help themselves. In pursuit of a dream that there exists some puritanical symbiotic partnership with another creature who's been wounded as they have.

If my cells truly wish to help, they should completely enslave themselves in a routine to which I pay no mind and never care to think about.
If nurses truly wish to help, they will clean up vomit and shit, ignore screams and pleads for lethal doses of morphine and bathe dementia ridden creatures such that they're clean enough to enjoy another day of delirious confusion, loneliness and pain.
If vets truly wish to help, they will put penelope down.

Even those aware of the costs tend to find themselves apathetic to the cause. Why? Fighting against harsh predicaments requires becoming a good fighter. Becoming a good fighter requires apathy to harsh predicaments (lol).

As a side note, the bizarrely primitive aphorisms in the mainstream memeplex ('stay positive', 'you are not alone' etc) are cut from the same cloth - they exist as basic building blocks to do with as you please. Maximum coverage, minimum effectiveness. 

Nothing new is being said of course:

> [*Mahayana sutras also depict the bodhisattva as a being which, because they want to reach Buddhahood for the sake of all beings, is more loving and compassionate than the sravaka (who only wishes to end their own suffering)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva). 
>
> [*Thus, another major difference between the bodhisattva and the arhat is that the bodhisattva practices the path for the good of others (par-ārtha), due to their bodhicitta, while the sravakas do so for their own good (sv-ārtha) and thus, do not have bodhicitta (which is compassionately focused on others)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva)


You are harvesting, you are being harvested and, no, death does not stop the harvest.
