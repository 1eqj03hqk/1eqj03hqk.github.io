## A short story

The boy watched from a-far, peering beside a large oak tree that stood a safe-enough-feeling distance away. It'd been 30 minutes since he first set eyes on her. His expression comprised a strange configuration of awe, shock and horror.

Off in the distance, a woman could be seen periodically laying down some sort of explosive, jumping on it, exploding into composite parts and then, after a couple of minutes, proceeding to pick each part up and graft herself back together.

Hours went by. 

Against his better judgement, he decided to walk up and ask the woman why she'd do such a thing. The woman responded:

> _In life, you'll come to learn that everything is defined in relation to some 'other'. Words are defined with yet more words. The most primitive of terms lay circularly defined such that A->B and B->A. Miraculously we're able to understand each other and you may wonder how such a programme can even operate with a lexicon of compiler errors._
> 
> _In short, what we think of as 'communication' occurs between two distinct agents. For all intents and purposes, we are not two seperate agents. When we 'communicate' we are merely reminding ourselves of a memory we've always had. Words act as pointers to those memories._
> 
> _Have you heard stories of great scientists and mathematicians stumbling upon answers only once they're on holiday or taking a break? This is because the answer's they seek, whatever they may be, lay dormant in the reflection of some particular composition of the environment - confining onesself to an empty familiar office is to confine the state-space of solutions to the composition of analogs already available to the mind._
" 

The boy thought on it for a couple of minutes. He'd heard of people like this before. Skitsofriendics his dad would call them.

> I think I got lost. What has this got to do with what your doing here?

The woman kneeled down and spoke more softly: 


> _Jump onto an explosive, let your limbs emulsify in the forest. When the time is right, gather each part and peice yourself back together again. If you're lucky, the infusion of flesh and earth may create a body that is both habitable and closer to the land that confuses you so dearly._
